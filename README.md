I’m Taciano Dreckmann Perez, a software engineer with 25+ years of experience and a PhD in Computer Science. I live in Eindhoven, The Netherlands with my wife, daughter, two cats, and a dog.

In this space, I share some of my personal and hobby projects. If you're interested in my professional activities, please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tacianoperez/) profile.

I have created [Story Inspector](https://www.storyinspector.com/), an open-source book analysis tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract information about works of fiction. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/taciano-perez/story-inspector).

I host a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TacianoPerez) exploring "vintage programming" in old 8-bit computers.

You can also check my [personal page]( https://sites.google.com/view/tacianodreckmannperez/home) for additional content, including restoration of old vacuum-tube radios.
